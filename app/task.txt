## Problem Statement

The residents of the Rick and Morty multi-verse would like an app to view a list of characters living in different dimensions. Use [this open API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch the required data.

## Requirements

Build two screens, one containing a list of `characters`, and the other containing a list of `locations`.

### Characters

0. Create a `Screen` named `Characters`, that displays a list of [`characters`](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character) using a `Card` layout, with 2 cards per row.
1. Each `Card` should display the `image`, `name`, `status`, `species`, `gender`, and `origin.name` values.
2. Users should be able to [filter the catalog](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters) by `status`, `species`, and `gender`. You may hardcode these values to apply as a filter.
3. Include a search field to return a list of characters by `name`.

### Locations

0. Create a `Screen` named `Locations`, that displays a list of [`locations`](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#location). 
1. Each `ListItem` should display the `name`, `type`, and `dimension`, and `number_of_residents` values.
2. When a `ListItem` is clicked, navigate to the `Characters` screen, with the `residents` of the `location` applied as a filter.

## Notes

0. The UI is completely up to you. Bonus points for a simple, practical user experience.
1. Implement lazy loading to update the list as the user scrolls through the list.
2. Implement "pull to refresh" on both lists.

## Must-haves

0. Redux.
1. Unit test coverage.

## Nice to Have

0. Offline support.
